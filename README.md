# ml-final-project
Course Project in CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning. Collaborated with my classmate Yuxuan Xia and instructed by Professor Mathieu Lauriere.

* Presented a deep learning approach to classify dolphin and whale species using both traditional machine learning models and the currently trending models like ResNet and Vision Transformer
* Compared and experimented transfer learning on multiple pretrained neural networks and identified potential domain shift problems that caused the learning to fail
